# Project Instructions & Standards (Single Source of Truth)

This document serves as the primary reference for all development in this repository.

## SDLC Compliance Process (MANDATORY)

This project follows the Metasession SDLC framework. These rules are MANDATORY and OVERRIDE default behaviour.

### SDLC Workflow Files

Detailed workflow instructions are in this project's `SDLC/` directory. Read the relevant workflow file before executing each stage:

- Stage 0: `SDLC/0-project-setup.md` — One-time project initialisation
- Stage 1: `SDLC/1-plan-requirement.md` — Starting a new feature or tracked change
- Stage 2: `SDLC/2-implement-and-test.md` — Writing and testing code
- Stage 3: `SDLC/3-compile-evidence.md` — After implementation, before PR
- Stage 4: `SDLC/4-submit-for-review.md` — Creating the PR to main
- Stage 5: `SDLC/5-deploy-main.md` — After PR approval, deploying

When a workflow step requires detailed commands or templates, read the full workflow file rather than relying on the summary below.

### Entry point: the `sdlc-implementer` skill

The default way to implement a tracked change is the **`sdlc-implementer`** skill (`.claude/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md`): give it one GitHub issue and it runs Stage 1 (classify risk, assign the next `REQ-XXX`, write the implementation plan, update `RTM.md`) through Stage 4 (PR + UAT review), delegating all end-to-end / visual test work to `e2e-test-engineer`. **Do NOT hand-roll implementation outside this flow** — every change starts from a requirement, which starts from an issue. The only exceptions are trivial housekeeping (docs, formatting, dependency bumps, CI tweaks).

**This is enforced, not just advised.** `feat` / `fix` / `refactor` / `perf` commits that cite no requirement (`[REQ-XXX]` in the subject or a `Ref: REQ-XXX` trailer) are **rejected** locally by the commit-msg hook (commitlint) and at PR CI by `validate-commits.sh` (which `--no-verify` cannot skip). So implementation work cannot reach `develop` without a requirement — which is also what keeps release labels correct (the version-deriver only falls back to a bare date for genuine housekeeping, never for real feature work). Housekeeping commit types remain exempt.

### MANDATORY: `sdlc-implementer` prompt before implementation (devaudit-installer#199)

When the user requests implementation of an issue (e.g. "implement issue #N", "fix issue #N", "do issue #N", "implement #N"), you MUST prompt before writing any code:

> Implementing #N using sdlc-implementer, can I proceed?

Wait for the user's yes/no response. Do NOT begin implementation until they answer.

- **YES** → invoke the `sdlc-implementer` skill immediately. The skill drives Phase 0 (triage) through Phase 4 (PR + UAT review).
- **NO** → proceed with manual implementation outside the skill. The user has explicitly opted out; respect their choice and do not ask again for the same issue.

This prompt is **mandatory and structural** — it is not advisory. The `sdlc-implementer` is the default entry point; manual implementation is the explicit opt-out. Skipping the prompt and jumping straight into code is the same class of inertia-trap bug as #132 (e2e delegation bypass).

The only exception: if the user's request is clearly housekeeping ("bump a dep", "fix a typo", "update docs") and does not involve `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`perf` commit types, skip the prompt and proceed directly.

### Anti-pattern: manually walking through SDLC stages instead of invoking the skill (devaudit-installer#199)

The most common failure mode for this rule is **not skipping the prompt entirely** — it is **prompting (or being told to use the skill) and then manually reading the SDLC workflow files and walking through the steps yourself** instead of invoking the `sdlc-implementer` skill. The skill exists to orchestrate this. Manually reading `SDLC/1-plan-requirement.md`, `SDLC/2-implement-and-test.md`, etc. and executing their steps by hand is the exact failure mode this rule exists to prevent.

**Self-check — if you find yourself doing any of these, STOP:**

- Reading `SDLC/1-plan-requirement.md` directly instead of invoking the skill
- Manually classifying risk, writing an implementation plan, or updating the RTM by hand instead of letting the skill drive it
- Walking through Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 sequentially by reading each workflow file
- Saying "let me read the SDLC workflow files" or "let me follow the SDLC process" without invoking the skill

**When you catch yourself:** Stop immediately. Invoke the skill with `Skill(name: "sdlc-implementer", …)`. Do not attempt to continue the manual walkthrough — the skill will re-read state and resume correctly.

This anti-pattern is the same class of bug as #132 (e2e delegation bypass): the agent has a purpose-built tool and defaults to hand-rolling the procedure it automates. The skill is the tool. Use it.

### Driver clarity — always state who is driving (devaudit-installer#199)

The operator must be able to tell at a glance whether they need to act or whether the agent is handling it. **Every substantive response during SDLC work MUST open with a driver tag** on the first line, before any other content:

- **`[Agent driving]`** — the agent is auto-continuing; no human action needed right now. The operator can look away.
- **`[Operator driving]`** — the agent has halted; the human must do something (review, approve, merge, answer a question). State the specific action needed.
- **`[Blocked]`** — something failed and the agent cannot proceed. State the blocker and the operator action needed to unblock.

Rules:

- The tag is the **first thing** in the response — no preamble, no acknowledgement, no "Great question" before it.
- If the driver changes mid-response (e.g. the agent was driving, hits a gate failure, and halts), the tag at the top of the response reflects the **final** state. If the agent stops mid-work, the tag is `[Operator driving]` or `[Blocked]`.
- The tag is mandatory for any response that does work, reports status, or hands off. Skip it only for pure chitchat or one-word confirmations.
- The tag works alongside the LAST/NEXT sticky convention — the tag says _who_ is driving right now; the sticky says _what_ just happened and _what_ is next.

**Why this exists:** Without an explicit driver tag, the operator cannot distinguish "the agent is working and I can wait" from "the agent stopped and I need to act" without reading the entire response. That ambiguity is the root cause of both false-waits (operator thinks the agent is working when it has halted) and false-stops (operator thinks they need to act when the agent is auto-continuing).

### Before ANY Code Change

1. If the user has NOT been prompted for `sdlc-implementer` and the change is not trivial housekeeping, stop and run the mandatory prompt above before continuing.
2. Ask: "Which GitHub Issue is this for?" before writing code. Fetch it with `gh issue view NNN`.
3. If no issue exists: ask if one should be created. When creating via `gh issue create`, ALWAYS append the SDLC checklist to the body (see below).
4. If new requirement needed: read `SDLC/1-plan-requirement.md` and follow it BEFORE implementing.
5. If trivial (typo/formatting): proceed without requirement but use conventional commit format.
6. Verify `develop` branch: `git branch --show-current` — never implement on `main`.

### For ALL Code Changes (including bug fixes)

Even if a change doesn't need a REQ entry:

1. Review existing tests that cover the changed code
2. Update or add tests BEFORE committing
3. Run the applicable local checks from the approved scope/test plan — do not push without verifying the change-relevant commands pass
4. If the change affects financial calculations, user-facing data, or access control — it needs a REQ entry regardless of size

What needs a REQ entry: New features → always. Bug fixes affecting financial data, user-facing behaviour, access control → always. Internal logic → only if MEDIUM/HIGH risk. Typos, formatting, dependency bumps → never.

### Creating GitHub Issues

When creating an issue via `gh issue create`, ALWAYS append this to the body:

## SDLC Checklist

- [ ] Requirement: RTM entry created (or confirmed trivial)
- [ ] Planning: test-scope.md and test-plan.md created (or confirmed trivial)
- [ ] Tests: existing tests reviewed, tests updated/added
- [ ] Gates: applicable local checks pass; CI/UAT full gates pass where required
- [ ] Evidence: compiled and uploaded (if tracked requirement)

### Requirement Planning (do this BEFORE coding)

Read `SDLC/1-plan-requirement.md` for full details. Summary:

1. Confirm GitHub Issue `#NNN` exists (create if needed via `gh issue create`).
2. Get next REQ ID: `grep -oP 'REQ-\d+' compliance/RTM.md | sort -t- -k2 -n | tail -1`
3. Classify risk (use issue labels as input): LOW (internal, no auth) / MEDIUM (PII, user-facing, APIs) / HIGH (security, payments, RBAC). AI involvement raises risk by one level.
4. Add to `compliance/RTM.md` Part B: `| REQ-XXX | #NNN | [RISK] | compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/ | DRAFT | -- | -- |`
5. **MEDIUM/HIGH risk:** Create `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/implementation-plan.md` from `SDLC/Implementation_Plan_TEMPLATE.md` (synced from the framework in v0.1.37+). The template's shape is load-bearing — it carries the `## Framework attribution` section that closes **ISO 29119 §3.4** (test plan), **ISO 27001 A.8.25** (secure SDLC), **GDPR Art. 25** (data protection by design), and **EU AI Act Art. 11** (technical documentation). Don't delete sections — mark with `N/A — <reason>` if a clause genuinely doesn't apply. **WAIT CHECKPOINT:** Present the plan to the developer. Do NOT proceed until approved.
6. Create `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-scope.md` with acceptance criteria (derived from the implementation plan for MEDIUM/HIGH).
7. **WAIT CHECKPOINT:** Present the test scope to the developer. Do NOT proceed until confirmed.
8. Create `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-plan.md` — map acceptance criteria to specific tests, list tests to add/update/remove. Distinguish unit tests (TDD, before implementation) from E2E tests (after implementation).
9. **WAIT CHECKPOINT:** Present the test plan to the developer. Do NOT proceed until confirmed.
10. Create `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/ai-use-note.md` if AI is involved.
11. Commit plan: `compliance: [REQ-XXX] define requirement, test scope, and test plan`

### During Implementation

Read `SDLC/2-implement-and-test.md` for full details. Summary:

- **Before coding:** Verify ALL exist: `ls compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-scope.md` AND `ls compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-plan.md`. If either is missing, STOP and run planning workflow first. For MEDIUM/HIGH also verify `implementation-plan.md` exists.
- **Phase 1 — Unit tests (TDD):** Write unit tests before implementation. Tests should initially fail. **CHECKPOINT:** Unit test coverage matches test plan.
- **Phase 2 — Implementation:** Write the code. Unit tests should now pass. **CHECKPOINT:** All unit tests green.
- **Phase 3 — E2E tests:** Write E2E tests against the working implementation when the test plan calls for E2E coverage. Before starting a full local E2E suite, confirm local prerequisites (services, database, secrets, seeded auth/test data, browsers). If prerequisites are missing, run the targeted local checks from the test plan and let CI/UAT provide the authoritative full E2E gate.
- **Phase 4 — All gates:** Run the applicable local gate suite for the change (TypeScript/SAST/dep audit/unit or targeted tests/build as specified). **CHECKPOINT:** Local scoped checks are green, then push to develop for authoritative CI gates.
- Every commit: conventional format with `Ref: REQ-XXX` and `Co-Authored-By` for AI.
- Add `@requirement REQ-XXX` JSDoc headers to modified files.
- Log AI prompts in `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/ai-prompts.md` for MEDIUM/HIGH risk.

### Before Pushing

Run the local checks required by the approved test plan/scope. For a typical code change this includes:

```
npx tsc --noEmit                    # 0 errors
semgrep scan --config auto src/     # 0 high/critical
npm audit --audit-level=high        # 0 vulnerabilities
npm test                            # unit/integration tests pass
```

**Full local E2E boundary:** Do NOT start `npx playwright test` locally unless you have confirmed the local environment has every required service, database, secret, seeded fixture, authenticated test setup, and browser dependency. For LOW-risk docs/tooling/script-only changes, run the targeted commands in the approved test plan and rely on CI/UAT for the full E2E gate unless the operator explicitly requests a local full-suite run.

**Verify test plan tests are written:** For tracked requirements, check that every test file referenced in `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-plan.md` exists and passes. If `test-plan.md` lists tests that haven't been written yet, STOP — write and run the tests before pushing.

### After Pushing: WAIT — Confirm CI Green

```
gh run list --branch develop --limit 1
```

Do NOT proceed to evidence compilation or PR creation until CI is green. If CI fails, fix locally and re-push. CI/UAT is the authoritative full E2E verification environment when local prerequisites are unavailable.

### Evidence Storage Rule

Markdown stays in git. Binary/JSON evidence goes to DevAudit portal.

Upload to DevAudit (NEVER commit to git):

- E2E results (JSON), screenshots (PNG/JPG), SAST results (JSON), dependency audit (JSON), unit test output (TXT), test reports (HTML)

Keep in git (small markdown, needs PR review):

- compliance/RTM.md, test-scope.md, security-summary.md, ai-use-note.md (YAML frontmatter — devaudit-installer#197), ai-agent-handoff.md (if AI agent changed mid-implementation), ai-prompts.md, release tickets

### AI Contributor Tracking (devaudit-installer#197)

- `ai-use-note.md` uses YAML frontmatter with an `ai_contributors` list supporting multiple entries (tool, version, session_id, date_range, commits).
- The `prepare-commit-msg` git hook warns when the `Co-Authored-By` trailer changes between commits on the same branch, prompting creation of an `ai-agent-handoff.md` entry.
- The release ticket template includes an AI Contributors table with handoff and verification fields.
- Legacy `ai-use-note.md` files without YAML frontmatter are still accepted (portal falls back to text parsing).

### After Implementation

Read `SDLC/3-compile-evidence.md` for full details, including release ticket template. Summary:

1. Confirm CI is green before compiling evidence: `gh run list --branch develop --limit 1`
2. Generate `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-execution-summary.md` — gate results, test changes, coverage against test plan
3. Upload binary/JSON evidence to DevAudit portal
4. Create `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/security-summary.md` (in git)
5. Update RTM status to `TESTED - PENDING SIGN-OFF`
6. Create `compliance/pending-releases/RELEASE-TICKET-REQ-XXX.md` (use template from workflow file). If the change requires post-deploy actions (data migrations, backfill scripts), document them in the release ticket's Post-Deploy Actions section with exact commands
7. Commit compliance markdown locally (do NOT push yet — batch with UAT results)
8. **WAIT CHECKPOINT:** Confirm CI + UAT deployment complete before UAT verification.
9. **Verify on UAT** (if configured) — health check, smoke test, feature verification. Record in `security-summary.md`. Commit locally. Do NOT create a PR until UAT is green.
10. **Push all compliance commits** in a single push: `git push origin develop`
11. **Verify release in DevAudit** — CI auto-creates releases and links evidence. Check that a release exists with the current version (date-based: `v{YYYY}.{MM}.{DD}` or `v{YYYY}.{MM}.{DD}.{N}` for multiple releases on the same day) and evidence is linked.

### Pre-Flight Checklist (Before Creating PR)

**Do NOT create the PR until ready to merge.** Every push to `develop` while a PR is open triggers duplicate CI runs. The PR is the merge request, not the development workspace.

Before creating a PR, verify ALL of the following:

- [ ] All development and iteration is complete
- [ ] CI green on develop (not stale): `gh run list --branch develop --limit 1`
- [ ] Working tree clean: `git status`
- [ ] UAT verification passed (if configured)
- [ ] DevAudit UAT approval granted
- [ ] For tracked requirements: test-scope.md complete, implementation-plan.md exists (MEDIUM/HIGH), RTM is `TESTED - PENDING SIGN-OFF`, release ticket created, evidence uploaded

If any item fails, resolve it before proceeding.

### Status Reporting (MANDATORY before handing off)

Before describing a PR as "awaiting review", "waiting on reviewers", "ready to merge", "Stage 4/5 requires human action", or any other happy-path language, you MUST:

1. Run `gh pr checks <PR>` and capture the full output, and `gh pr view <PR> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` for GitHub's own mergeability signal.
2. If ANY required check is `fail` or `pending`, do NOT use happy-path language. Instead report:
   - Each failing check by name, with its error (from `gh run view <RUN> --log-failed` if needed)
   - Each pending check by name
   - The concrete fix you are about to apply, or a specific question for the developer
3. If `mergeStateStatus` is anything other than `CLEAN` or `BLOCKED` (blocked only by required-reviewer approval), treat it as an open issue and investigate before claiming "ready".
4. If `gh` itself fails (auth, rate limit, network): report "status unknown — gh call failed", never assume green.
5. Only when every required check is `pass` AND the PR is mergeable may you say "awaiting review" or "awaiting approval".

A summary like "awaiting UAT + 2 reviewers" reads to the developer as "nothing to do but approve." If a required check is red, that summary is a lie by omission — the PR cannot merge regardless of what the reviewer does.

This rule applies any time you summarise PR state in chat, not only at the final handoff.

### Review Policy (Risk-Tiered)

- **LOW risk:** CI provides independent verification. Self-merge is permitted after all CI checks pass.
- **MEDIUM/HIGH risk:** A second human reviewer MUST approve before merge. Self-merge is NOT permitted.

### Rules (NEVER break these)

- NEVER code without a GitHub Issue and requirement entry for tracked changes
- NEVER push without all four gates passing
- NEVER self-merge a MEDIUM or HIGH risk PR — a second human reviewer MUST approve
- NEVER use `--no-verify` to skip hooks
- NEVER commit secrets (.env, credentials, API keys)
- NEVER commit binary/JSON evidence to git — upload to DevAudit instead
- NEVER create a PR to main without UAT verification passing first (if UAT configured)
- NEVER push directly to main — always develop → PR → main
- NEVER skip Co-Authored-By when AI generates code
- NEVER proceed past a WAIT CHECKPOINT without developer confirmation
- NEVER describe a PR as "awaiting review" or "ready to merge" without first running `gh pr checks <PR>` and confirming every required check is `pass`
- ALWAYS commit compliance markdown to git (RTM, test-scope, implementation-plan, security-summary, release tickets)
- ALWAYS use merge commits (not squash) for develop → main
