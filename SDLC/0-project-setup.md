description: One-time project setup — configure repository, CI pipeline, compliance structure, and tooling before workflows can run
---

# Project Setup Guide

**Document Type:** Setup Guide | **Run Once:** At project start, before any workflow is executed

**Parent Documents:** Test Policy, Test Strategy, Test Architecture (all Tier 1, in META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/)

---

## Purpose

This guide configures a new project so that the five pipeline workflows can run correctly. It sets up the repository structure, branch protection, CI pipeline (the independent verification gate), compliance directories, and local tooling.

**Run this guide once when starting a new project.** The pipeline workflows (1-5) assume this setup is complete.

---

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository created
- Hosting platform configured (Railway, Vercel, AWS, etc.) with auto-deploy from `main` (production)
- UAT environment configured (recommended) with auto-deploy from `develop`
- Local development environment working (app builds and runs)
- Node.js and npm installed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated

---

## Step 1: Branch Structure

Create the permanent working branch:

```bash
# Ensure main exists and is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

**Branch roles:**

- `main` — Production. Auto-deploys. Never commit directly.
- `develop` — All work happens here. Permanent, never deleted.

---

## Step 2: Branch Protection Rules

Configure in GitHub → Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules:

**`main` branch:**

- [x] Require a pull request before merging
- [x] Require approvals: 1 (adjust if team size requires more)
- [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Add these required checks after CI is configured (Step 4):
    - `typecheck`
    - `sast`
    - `dependency-audit`
    - `e2e-tests`
- [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [x] Do not allow bypassing the above settings

**`develop` branch (optional but recommended):**

- [x] Require status checks to pass (push-to-develop checks)

---

## Step 3: Compliance Directory Structure

```bash
# Create compliance directories
mkdir -p compliance/evidence/periodic/{sast-quarterly,dependency-audit,access-control,audit-log,pentest,dr-test,third-party}
mkdir -p compliance/pending-releases
mkdir -p compliance/approved-releases

# Create initial RTM
cat > compliance/RTM.md << 'EOF'
# Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Project:** [PROJECT NAME]
**Standard:** ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2021

## Part A: Baseline Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

## Part B: Change Request Traceability

| REQ-ID | Issue | Risk | Evidence | Status | Approver | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
EOF

# Commit
git add compliance/
git commit -m "compliance: initialize compliance directory structure"
git push origin develop
```

---

## Step 4: CI Pipeline Configuration

This is the **independent verification gate**. Tests run locally during development (comprehensive, all tests). Tests run in CI during PR review (independent, tamper-resistant evidence produced by GitHub, not the developer).

### What CI Must Run

| Pipeline | Trigger           | Jobs                                               | Purpose                                  |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CI       | Push to `develop` | TypeScript + SAST + dependency audit + E2E + build | Quality gates + independent verification |
| Deploy   | Merge to `main`   | Auto-deploy to hosting platform                    | Production release                       |

PRs to `main` do not trigger a separate CI run. Branch protection required status checks ensure the commit already passed Quality Gates on the develop push. This avoids duplicate CI runs.

### GitHub Actions Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]
    paths-ignore: # Skip full CI for non-code changes
      - '.github/workflows/**'
      - 'SDLC/**'
      - 'compliance/**'
      - '*.md'
      - '.cursorrules'
      - '.windsurfrules'
# PRs to main inherit commit status via branch protection required status checks.
# No pull_request trigger needed — avoids duplicate CI runs.

### Customization Checklist

After creating the workflow file, update every line marked `# UPDATE`:

- [ ] Node.js version matches your project
- [ ] `src/` path in SAST scan matches your source directory
- [ ] Database service matches your database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- [ ] Environment variables set for your app to start
- [ ] Seed script path is correct
- [ ] E2E test command runs the correct subset (unauthenticated for CI)
- [ ] Build command is correct

### Verify CI Works

```bash
# Commit the workflow file
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "ci: configure CI pipeline with independent verification gates"
git push origin develop

# Create a test PR to verify all jobs pass
gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "ci: verify pipeline configuration" --body "Testing CI pipeline setup"

# Watch the checks run
gh pr checks
```

Once all checks pass, go back to GitHub → Settings → Branches → `main` protection rules and add the job names as required status checks: `typecheck`, `sast`, `dependency-audit`, `e2e-tests`, `compliance-validation`.

Now the PR **cannot be merged** unless all four independent verification gates pass. This is enforced by GitHub, not by the developer.

### After CI Is Configured

The relationship between local testing and CI testing:

```
Developer Machine (comprehensive)          GitHub Actions (independent)
─────────────────────────────────          ──────────────────────────────
TypeScript check ──────────────────────→   TypeScript check
SAST scan (Semgrep) ───────────────────→   SAST scan (Semgrep)
Dependency audit ──────────────────────→   Dependency audit
E2E tests (ALL — e.g., 183) ──────────→   E2E tests (unauthenticated subset)
E2E tests (authenticated — local only)     ✗ (credentials not in CI)
Post-deploy verification (local only)      ✗ (runs after merge)

Evidence → compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/    Evidence → GitHub Actions logs + artifacts
(comprehensive, developer-produced)        (independent, tamper-resistant)
```

Both are required. Local evidence proves comprehensive testing. CI evidence proves it independently.

### Additional Workflows

Copy these template workflows from `sdlc/files/ci/` into your project's `.github/workflows/`:

**`check-uat-approval.yml`** — UAT approval gate:

- Runs on PRs to `main` and `workflow_dispatch`
- Queries META-COMPLY for release approval status
- Blocks merge unless release is `uat_approved`
- Add `Check UAT Approval` as a required status check on `main`

**`post-deploy-prod.yml`** — Production evidence capture:

- Runs on push to `main` (after merge)
- Waits for deployment, runs production smoke tests
- Uploads production evidence to META-COMPLY (`environment: production`)
- Marks the release as `released` in META-COMPLY

**Versioning convention:** Releases use date-based versions by default (`v2026.03.27`). CI auto-creates releases in META-COMPLY when uploading evidence. Update `PROJECT_SLUG` and `PRODUCTION_URL` in each template.

---

## Step 5: Local Tooling Setup (Required)

### 5a. Security scanning tools

```bash
# SAST
pip install semgrep
# or: npm install --save-dev semgrep

# Verify
semgrep --version
npm audit --help
```

### 5b. Playwright

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 5c. Git hooks (required — enforces commit conventions and pre-push gates)

Install husky, commitlint, and lint-staged:

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional lint-staged
npx husky init
```

Copy hook templates from META-COMPLY SDLC:

```bash
# From your project root (adjust path to META-COMPLY)
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/commit-msg .husky/commit-msg
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/pre-commit .husky/pre-commit
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/pre-push .husky/pre-push
chmod +x .husky/commit-msg .husky/pre-commit .husky/pre-push

# Copy commitlint config
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/commitlint.config.mjs commitlint.config.mjs
```

Add lint-staged configuration to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix"],
    "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

Add the prepare script so hooks install automatically for new clones:

```bash
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="husky"
```

### 5d. JSDoc requirement check script (optional — for CI enforcement)

```bash
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/scripts/check-requirement-jsdoc.sh scripts/check-requirement-jsdoc.sh
chmod +x scripts/check-requirement-jsdoc.sh
```

### 5e. Verify hooks work

```bash
# Test commitlint (should fail — missing type prefix)
echo "bad commit message" | npx commitlint
# Expected: error

# Test commitlint (should pass)
echo "feat: test commit message" | npx commitlint
# Expected: no errors (warnings about missing Ref/Co-Authored-By are OK)

# Test pre-push hook
npx tsc --noEmit
# Expected: passes (or shows real errors to fix)
```

---

## Step 6: Create Project Test Plan

Copy `Test_Plan_TEMPLATE.md` from META-COMPLY (`sdlc/files/Test_Plan_TEMPLATE.md`) to `compliance/test-plan.md` and fill in:

- [ ] Project name and repository
- [ ] Stack and hosting details
- [ ] Production URL and health endpoint
- [ ] Database configuration
- [ ] Test suite counts and framework
- [ ] Entry/exit criteria with actual thresholds
- [ ] AI tool permissions for this project
- [ ] Disaster recovery targets (RTO/RPO)
- [ ] Penetration test scope

```bash
git add compliance/test-plan.md
git commit -m "compliance: project test plan"
git push origin develop
```

---

## Step 7: Verify Everything Works

Run through the complete pipeline once with a small test change:

```bash
# 1. Plan (workflow 1)
# Create a test requirement in RTM

# 2. Implement (workflow 2)
# Make a small change, run all local gates

# 3. Compile evidence (workflow 3)
# Generate compliance artifacts

# 4. Submit for review (workflow 4)
# Create PR — verify all CI checks run and pass

# 5. Deploy (workflow 5)
# Merge, verify deployment, finalize compliance
```

If any step fails, fix the configuration before starting real work.

---

## What Happens Next

With setup complete, all development follows the five pipeline workflows:

```
1-plan-requirement.md       → Define requirement, classify risk, generate test scope
2-implement-and-test.md     → Code, commit, run all local gates, auto-deploy to UAT
3-compile-evidence.md       → Gather evidence, verify on UAT, create release ticket
4-submit-for-review.md      → Create PR (CI runs independent verification)
5-deploy-main.md            → Merge, verify production deployment, finalize
```

The CI pipeline runs automatically on every PR. The developer doesn't need to trigger it — GitHub handles it. The branch protection rules prevent merging if CI fails. The human reviewer sees both local evidence (in the compliance directory) and CI evidence (in the PR checks) before approving.
