# [PROJECT NAME] — Development & Compliance Workflow System

**Standard:** ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2021 | **Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** [DATE]

---

## Document Structure

### Tier 1 — Universal (Metasession-wide)

| Document | Owns |
|----------|------|
| **Test Policy** | Why we test, commitments, AI governance, roles, accountability |
| **Test Strategy** | How we approach testing — methodology, risk classification, security, AI protocol |
| **Test Architecture** | What we build with — tools, patterns, code standards, CI config |
| **Periodic Security Review** | When periodic security activities happen |

### Tier 2 — Project-Specific

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Project Setup** | One-time: repository, CI, compliance configuration |
| **Test Plan** | Environment, test suites, exit criteria, AI config, evidence |
| **Workflows 0-5** | Operational pipeline procedures |

---

## Pipeline

```
 0. SETUP         One-time: repo, CI, compliance dirs, tooling (0-project-setup.md)
 1. PLAN          Define requirement, classify risk, generate test scope
 2. IMPLEMENT     Code on develop, run all local gates
 3. EVIDENCE      Compile test + security + AI evidence
 4. PR            Create PR → CI runs independent verification automatically
 5. REVIEW        Human reviews code + CI results + evidence
 6. APPROVE       PR approval = formal sign-off
 7. MERGE         Auto-deploy to production
 8. VERIFY        Health + security verification
 9. FINALIZE      RTM closed, release ticket approved
```

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Workflows |
|----------|-----------|
| New project setup | 0 (once) |
| New feature (tracked) | 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → (CI + review) → 5 |
| Bug fix / docs / config | 2 → 4 → (CI + review) → 5 |

## Mandatory Gates

| Gate | Local | CI (PR) | Threshold |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| TypeScript | Yes | Yes | 0 errors |
| SAST | Yes | Yes | 0 high/critical |
| Dependencies | Yes | Yes | 0 high/critical |
| E2E (Playwright) | All | Unauthenticated subset | All pass |
| Human review | — | PR approved | Approved |

## Risk Levels

| Level | Extra Requirements |
|-------|-------------------|
| Low | Standard gates |
| Medium | + access control + audit log testing |
| High | + pen test consideration + independent review |

AI in Medium/High categories raises risk one level.

## CI/CD

| Trigger | What Runs |
|---------|-----------|
| Push to `develop` | TypeScript + build |
| PR to `main` | TypeScript + SAST + deps + E2E (unauthenticated) |
| Merge to `main` | Auto-deploy |

CI is the independent verification gate — evidence produced by GitHub, not the developer. See Test Plan for details.

## How to Use: Prompt Guide

This system is designed to be driven by prompts to your AI assistant. Each workflow is triggered by giving the AI the right context and instruction. The AI reads the workflow file, follows the steps, and produces the required artifacts.

### Starting a New Project

```
Read 0-project-setup.md and execute the full project setup for [PROJECT NAME].

The project is a [brief description] built with [stack]. It's hosted on [platform]
at [URL]. The database is [database type].

Set up the repository structure, branch protection, CI pipeline, compliance
directories, and create the project Test Plan from the template.
```

### Workflow 1: Planning a New Feature

**Simple feature (likely Low risk):**

```
Read 1-plan-requirement.md and plan a new requirement.

I want to add [describe the feature]. Follow the workflow: determine the next
REQ ID, classify the risk level, add the RTM entry, create the evidence
directory, generate the test scope, and commit.
```

**Feature touching sensitive areas (likely Medium/High):**

```
Read 1-plan-requirement.md and plan a new requirement.

I want to modify the [authentication/payment/user data] system to [describe
the change]. This touches [security-sensitive area] so classify risk
appropriately. Follow the full workflow including the AI use note since
you'll be generating the implementation code.
```

### Workflow 2: Implementation

**Standard implementation:**

```
Read 2-implement-and-test.md and implement REQ-XXX.

Refer to the test scope in compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-scope.md for
what needs to be tested. Implement the feature, add JSDoc headers, run all
local gates (TypeScript, SAST, dependency audit, E2E tests), and push to develop.
```

**Resuming after a break:**

```
Read 2-implement-and-test.md. I'm continuing work on REQ-XXX.

Check the current state: verify we're on develop, review what's been done so
far, check what items remain in the test scope, and continue implementation.
Run all gates before pushing.
```

**Fixing a failing gate:**

```
Read 2-implement-and-test.md. The SAST scan found issues after my last commit.

Review the findings, fix the legitimate issues, document any false positives
in compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/sast-review.md, and re-run all gates.
```

### Workflow 3: Compiling Evidence

**After implementation is complete:**

```
Read 3-compile-evidence.md and compile all evidence for REQ-XXX.

Verify all gates pass, save test evidence, save security evidence (SAST +
dependency audit), verify AI use documentation is complete, check that all
test scope items are addressed, update the RTM, generate the release ticket,
and commit everything.
```

### Workflow 4: Submitting for Review

**Creating the PR:**

```
Read 4-submit-for-review.md and create the PR for REQ-XXX.

Verify develop is ready, review what will be in the PR, create it with the
full compliance checklist, and link it to the release ticket. Then check
that CI starts running.
```

**After CI fails on the PR:**

```
Read 4-submit-for-review.md, Step 4 (Wait for CI). CI failed on the PR.

Check which job failed using gh pr checks, diagnose the issue, fix it,
re-run local gates to confirm, and push so CI re-runs.
```

**After reviewer requests changes:**

```
Read 4-submit-for-review.md, Step 7 (Handle Feedback). The reviewer
requested changes: [describe the feedback].

Make the requested changes, re-run all local gates, update security evidence
if needed, and push to develop.
```

### Workflow 5: Deploying

**After PR is approved:**

```
Read 5-deploy-main.md and deploy REQ-XXX.

Merge the PR, sync branches, verify the deployment (health check, smoke test,
security verification), finalize the compliance artifacts (move release ticket,
update RTM, add audit trail entries), and do the final sync.
```

**If deployment fails:**

```
Read 5-deploy-main.md, Rollback section. The deployment is failing.

[Describe the symptoms]. Execute the rollback procedure and document it in
the release ticket audit trail.
```

### Untracked Changes (No REQ — Bug Fixes, Docs, Config)

**Quick fix:**

```
Read 2-implement-and-test.md. I need to fix a bug: [describe the bug].

This doesn't need a tracked requirement. Implement the fix, run all local gates,
commit, and push. Then read 4-submit-for-review.md and create a PR with the
simplified untracked changes template.
```

### Periodic Security Reviews

**Quarterly review:**

```
Read the Periodic Security Review Schedule and execute the quarterly review
for this project.

Run the full codebase SAST scan, dependency deep audit, access control review,
and audit log integrity check. Save all evidence to the periodic directories.
```

**Annual penetration test prep:**

```
Read the Periodic Security Review Schedule, annual penetration testing section.

Prepare the scope document for the pen tester based on our project's Test Plan.
List the target URLs, API endpoints, authentication mechanism, and any specific
areas of concern.
```

### Tips for Effective Prompts

**Always reference the workflow file.** Starting with "Read [workflow].md" ensures the AI follows the documented process rather than improvising.

**Provide context the AI needs.** The AI knows the workflow steps but doesn't know what you're building unless you tell it. Describe the feature, the area of the codebase, and any constraints.

**Let the AI classify risk.** Don't pre-classify unless you're certain. The AI applies the risk matrix from the Test Strategy consistently. If you disagree with its classification, discuss it — the human always has final say.

**Chain workflows naturally.** You don't need to complete one workflow in a single prompt. Break long sessions across multiple prompts. The compliance artifacts (RTM, evidence directory, test scope) maintain state between sessions.

**Use "continue" for long workflows.** Implementation (workflow 2) often spans multiple sessions:

```
Continue with REQ-XXX. Where did we leave off? Check the test scope
and resume from there.
```

**For the full pipeline in one session** (small features):

```
Read the workflow files 1 through 5. I want to implement [small feature].

Run through the entire pipeline: plan the requirement, implement it, compile
evidence, create the PR, and after approval, deploy. This is a straightforward
change so it should be Low risk.
```

## META-COMPLY Integration

META-COMPLY is the centralised compliance evidence portal for all Metasession projects. It replaces git-based evidence storage with a web application that provides secure, auditor-accessible evidence management.

**What changes when META-COMPLY is active:**

### Evidence Storage (Workflow 3: Compile Evidence)

Evidence artifacts are uploaded to META-COMPLY instead of being committed to git.

| Before (git-based) | After (META-COMPLY) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `cp e2e-results.json compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/` | CLI script or CI uploads to META-COMPLY |
| `git add compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/` | Binary artifacts excluded via `.gitignore` |
| Evidence only visible to repo collaborators | Evidence visible to anyone with an access grant |
| Screenshots bloat git history permanently | Files stored in Supabase Storage, not git |

**What stays in git:**
- `compliance/RTM.md` — source of truth for requirement tracking
- `compliance/test-plan.md` — project test plan
- `compliance/test-cases.md` — test case specifications
- `compliance/test-summary-report.md` — test execution summary
- `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-scope.md` — pre-implementation test scope (text, not binary)
- `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/ai-use-note.md` — AI involvement records (text)
- `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/security-summary.md` — security summary (text)
- Release tickets in `compliance/pending-releases/` and `compliance/approved-releases/`

**What moves to META-COMPLY:**
- Screenshots (PNG, JPEG) from E2E test runs
- `e2e-results.json` and other generated test result files
- `sast-results.json` and `dependency-audit.json`
- Playwright HTML reports
- Any other binary or generated artifacts

### Compliance Document Syncing

CI automatically uploads read-only snapshots of the compliance source documents (RTM, test plan, test cases, test summary report) to META-COMPLY on every merge to `main`. Auditors see the full compliance picture — planning documents alongside evidence — in one place, without needing repository access.

The source of truth for these documents remains in git. Developers continue to edit them as part of the normal workflow. META-COMPLY holds read-only copies tagged with the git SHA they were synced from.

### CI Pipeline Changes

Add the META-COMPLY evidence upload step to your CI workflow, after tests pass. The upload script is available in the META-COMPLY repository at `scripts/upload-evidence.sh`. Download it to your project or reference it directly.

```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/ci.yml, after the E2E test job
upload-evidence:
  name: Upload Evidence to META-COMPLY
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [e2e-tests]
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Upload test artifacts
    - name: Upload E2E evidence
      run: |
        ./scripts/upload-evidence.sh \
          --project [PROJECT_SLUG] \
          --requirement "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}" \
          --type e2e_result \
          --git-sha "${{ github.sha }}" \
          --ci-run-id "${{ github.run_id }}" \
          --path playwright-report/
      env:
        SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}
        SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}

    # Upload security evidence
    - name: Upload SAST evidence
      run: |
        ./scripts/upload-evidence.sh \
          --project [PROJECT_SLUG] \
          --requirement "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}" \
          --type test_report \
          --git-sha "${{ github.sha }}" \
          --path sast-results.json
      env:
        SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}
        SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}

# Sync compliance docs on merge to main
sync-compliance-docs:
  name: Sync Compliance Documents
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Upload compliance documents
      run: |
        for doc in compliance/RTM.md compliance/test-plan.md compliance/test-cases.md compliance/test-summary-report.md; do
          [ -f "$doc" ] && ./scripts/upload-evidence.sh \
            --project [PROJECT_SLUG] \
            --requirement _compliance-docs \
            --type compliance_document \
            --git-sha "${{ github.sha }}" \
            --path "$doc"
        done
      env:
        SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}
        SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}
```

### .gitignore Updates

Add to your project's `.gitignore` to stop tracking binary evidence:

```gitignore
# Compliance binary evidence (stored in META-COMPLY)
compliance/evidence/**/*.json
compliance/evidence/**/*.png
compliance/evidence/**/*.jpeg
compliance/evidence/**/*.html
compliance/evidence/**/screenshots/
compliance/evidence/**/playwright-report/
compliance/evidence/adhoc-*/
```

### Workflow 3 Prompt (Updated)

When META-COMPLY is active, the evidence compilation prompt changes:

```
Read 3-compile-evidence.md and compile all evidence for REQ-XXX.

Verify all gates pass. For binary evidence (screenshots, JSON results,
HTML reports), upload to META-COMPLY using the CLI script instead of
committing to git. Keep text-based evidence (test-scope.md, security-summary.md,
ai-use-note.md) in git. Update the RTM, generate the release ticket, and commit.
```

### Access for Auditors

Project admins manage auditor access through META-COMPLY:

1. Navigate to the project in META-COMPLY
2. Go to Access Management
3. Enter the auditor's email, select "viewer" role, set an optional expiry date
4. The auditor receives a magic link email — no password required
5. Revoke access at any time from the same page

For one-off reviews, generate a time-limited share link instead of creating an account.

### Required Secrets

Add these to your GitHub repository secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

| Secret | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Service role key (server-side only) | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API |

### Project Registration

Before CI can upload evidence, the project must be registered in META-COMPLY:

1. Sign in to META-COMPLY as an admin
2. Create a new project with the project slug matching `[PROJECT_SLUG]` used in CI
3. The storage namespace and access grants are created automatically
