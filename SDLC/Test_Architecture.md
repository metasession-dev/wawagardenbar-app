# Test Architecture

**Document Type:** Architecture Standards | **Version:** 2.0 | **Effective Date:** March 2026 | **Review Cycle:** Annual

**Owner:** QA Team / Test Engineers | **Approved By:** Engineering Leadership

---

## Purpose

This document defines the technical standards for how Metasession builds and structures test infrastructure. It specifies mandatory tools, frameworks, directory structures, design patterns, code conventions, CI/CD pipeline configuration, environment setup, and artifact storage.

This document answers **"what we build tests with and how we structure the code."** For why we test and our governance commitments, see the Test Policy (`sdlc/files/Test_Policy.md` in META-COMPLY). For how we approach testing methodically, see the Test Strategy.

Individual products implement these standards as documented in product-specific Test Plans.

---

## Scope

These standards apply to all Metasession products, client engagements, and internal systems.

---

## 1. Architectural Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Reusable test utilities and helper functions across suites
- Shared fixtures and base classes
- Centralized configuration management
- Common assertion libraries and custom matchers

### Isolation

- Each test runs independently without side effects
- Database state reset between test runs
- External dependencies mocked to prevent flakiness
- Parallel execution enabled without interference

### Speed over Exhaustiveness

- Fast feedback prioritized (unit tests < 30 seconds)
- Parallelization and sharding for E2E suites
- Strategic test selection based on code changes
- Regression suites optimized for execution time

### Traceability

- Tests linked to requirements via ticket IDs
- BDD feature files tagged with requirement references
- Automated requirement-test-result mapping

---

## 2. Test Pyramid Implementation

## 4. Project Structure

All products organize tests in a centralized `/tests` directory:

```
/tests
  /__tests__              # Unit tests (mirrors src structure)
  /integration            # Integration tests
  /e2e                    # End-to-end tests
    /playwright           # Playwright test specs
    /pages                # Page Object Models (required)
    /components           # Component objects
  /bdd                    # BDD feature files (Gherkin)
  /performance            # Performance tests
  /visual                 # Visual regression tests (optional)
  /accessibility          # Accessibility tests
  /setup                  # Test utilities & configuration
    /fixtures             # Test data fixtures
    /mocks                # Mock implementations
    /utils                # Helper utilities
    /factories            # Data factories
  /config                 # Test framework configurations
  /reports                # Test reports (gitignored)
```

---

## 5. Design Patterns

### Page Object Model (Required for E2E)

All E2E tests must use the Page Object Model pattern:

- Page classes in `/tests/e2e/pages/`
- Component objects for reusable UI elements
- Locators defined as class properties
- Methods for user interactions
- No assertions in page objects — assertions belong in test files

### Custom Fixtures (Required)

Products must implement:

- Authentication fixtures (login states, session management)
- Database seeding/cleanup fixtures
- Test data factories using Faker.js and Fishery

### Shared Utilities (Required)

- Authentication helpers
- Date/time manipulation utilities
- Storage helpers (localStorage, cookies)
- Custom matchers and assertions

---

## 6. Test Data Management

### Strategy by Test Level

| Test Level  | Data Strategy          | Rationale                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Unit        | Mocked data            | Fast, predictable                 |
| Integration | In-memory DB or MSW    | Isolated, controlled              |
| E2E (local) | Test database (Docker) | Real behavior, containerized      |
| E2E (CI)    | Ephemeral database     | Production-like, auto-provisioned |
| Staging     | Dedicated staging DB   | Production-equivalent, anonymized |

### Data Factories (Required)

- Faker.js for realistic data generation
- Fishery for factory definitions
- Factories reusable across test types

### GDPR Compliance (Mandatory)

- No production PII in non-production environments
- Synthetic data for all test scenarios
- Data masking when copying production data
- Automatic cleanup after execution
- Access controls on test databases

---

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Standards

### Required Pipeline Stages

All products implement these stages in order:

| Stage                | Purpose                                    | Exit Criteria            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1. Lint              | ESLint + Prettier validation               | 0 errors                 |
| 2. Type Check        | Strict compilation                         | 0 errors                 |
| 3. Unit Tests        | Component-level testing with coverage      | Meets coverage target    |
| 4. Security Scans    | SAST + SCA                                 | 0 high/critical findings |
| 5. Integration Tests | API and service validation                 | All pass                 |
| 6. E2E Tests         | Full Playwright suite with parallelization | All critical paths pass  |
| 7. Build             | Production build verification              | Succeeds                 |
| 8. Report            | Artifact upload and status reporting       | Artifacts stored         |

PR cannot merge unless all stages pass.

### Parallelization (Required)

- E2E tests sharded across minimum 4 workers
- Matrix strategy for multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

### Release Pipeline

- Semantic versioning via Conventional Commits (release-please or equivalent)
- Changelog generated from commit messages
- GitHub releases with version tags
- Deployment pipeline triggered on merge to production branch

### Git Hooks Configuration (Required)

Hook templates are provided in `sdlc/files/hooks/` in the META-COMPLY repository. Copy them into your project during setup (see `0-project-setup.md` Step 5c).

**Pre-commit** (`.husky/pre-commit` — template: `hooks/pre-commit`):

- Runs lint-staged on staged files (ESLint + Prettier)
- Blocks commit on failure

**Commit-msg** (`.husky/commit-msg` — template: `hooks/commit-msg`):

- Runs commitlint to validate Conventional Commits format
- Required format: `type(scope): description`
- Warns on missing `Ref: REQ-XXX` and `Co-Authored-By` trailers
- Configuration: `commitlint.config.mjs` (template: `hooks/commitlint.config.mjs`)

**Pre-push** (`.husky/pre-push` — template: `hooks/pre-push`):

- TypeScript compilation check (`tsc --noEmit`) as a fast gate
- Full test suite, SAST, and dependency audit run in CI — not in the pre-push hook (too slow for a local gate)
- Blocks push on TypeScript errors

**Setup:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional lint-staged
npx husky init
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/commit-msg .husky/commit-msg
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/pre-commit .husky/pre-commit
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/pre-push .husky/pre-push
chmod +x .husky/commit-msg .husky/pre-commit .husky/pre-push
cp path/to/META-COMPLY/sdlc/files/hooks/commitlint.config.mjs commitlint.config.mjs
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="husky"
```

## 8. Artifact Storage

| Artifact             | Storage                      | Retention              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Test results (HTML)  | GitHub Actions artifacts     | 90 days                |
| Screenshots          | GitHub Actions artifacts     | 90 days                |
| Videos               | GitHub Actions artifacts     | 90 days                |
| Coverage reports     | Codecov                      | Indefinite             |
| JUnit XML            | GitHub Actions + Qase        | 90 days + Indefinite   |
| Release artifacts    | AWS S3 / Azure Blob          | 3-7 years (compliance) |
| Security scans       | Snyk + SonarQube dashboards  | Indefinite             |
| SAST evidence (JSON) | Project compliance directory | 3 years minimum        |
| Dependency audits    | Project compliance directory | 3 years minimum        |

### Flakiness Handling (Required)

- Retry strategy: 2 retries in CI, 0 locally
- Automatic quarantine detection for flaky tests
- Flaky tests create issues automatically
- Flaky tests addressed immediately or disabled with documented justification

---

## 9. File Naming & Code Style

### Naming Conventions

| File Type         | Pattern                   | Example                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Unit tests        | `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx` | `auth.test.ts`            |
| Integration tests | `*.integration.test.ts`   | `api.integration.test.ts` |
| E2E tests         | `*.spec.ts`               | `login.spec.ts`           |
| BDD features      | `*.feature`               | `authentication.feature`  |
| Page objects      | `*Page.ts` (PascalCase)   | `LoginPage.ts`            |
| Accessibility     | `*.a11y.test.ts`          | `navigation.a11y.test.ts` |

### ESLint Configuration

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
    'plugin:playwright/recommended',
    'prettier',
  ],
  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
  plugins: ['@typescript-eslint', 'playwright'],
  rules: {
    'playwright/no-skipped-test': 'warn',
    'playwright/no-focused-test': 'error',
    'playwright/valid-expect': 'error',
    'playwright/prefer-web-first-assertions': 'warn',
    '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'warn',
    '@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type': 'off',
    'no-console': ['warn', { allow: ['warn', 'error'] }],
  },
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['*.test.ts', '*.test.tsx', '*.spec.ts'],
      rules: {
        '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'off',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

### Prettier Configuration

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 100,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

### Test Code Style

- Descriptive test names (sentences, not code identifiers)
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Maximum 1 assertion concept per test
- No test interdependencies
- BDD scenarios use Given/When/Then structure
- Test code maintained to same quality standards as product code
- Code review required for all test automation changes

---

## 10. Environment Configuration

### Environment Files

```
.env.local              # Local development (not committed)
.env.test               # Test environment (committed, no secrets)
.env.staging            # Staging (secrets in CI/CD only)
.env.production         # Production (secrets in CI/CD only)
.env.example            # Template for developers (committed)
```

### Secret Management

- All secrets in CI/CD platform secret storage (GitHub Actions Secrets)
- No secrets committed to version control
- Separate secrets per environment
- Rotation policy for sensitive credentials

### Containerization

- Docker Compose for local test environment
- Health checks for all services
- Automatic cleanup of containers
- Consistent environment across local and CI

---

## 11. Coverage & Quality Thresholds

| Metric                                | Target      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Unit test coverage (critical modules) | 70% minimum |
| Integration point coverage            | 80% minimum |
| Critical user path E2E coverage       | 100%        |
| Security scan (high/critical)         | 0 findings  |
| Accessibility (public-facing)         | WCAG 2.1 AA |

### Quality Metrics (Required Tracking)

- Test coverage percentage by module
- Test execution time and trends
- Flaky test rate
- Bug escape rate (production defects not caught)
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)

### Review Cadence

- **Monthly** — Test suite health check
- **Quarterly** — Architecture standards review
- **Ongoing** — Remove obsolete tests, update documentation

---

## Product-Specific Implementation

Each product creates a product-specific Test Plan that:

1. Implements these organizational architecture standards
2. Documents product-specific configurations (framework versions, database schemas, URLs)
3. Provides practical examples for the product's stack
4. Defines migration timelines for implementing standards (if not yet fully compliant)
5. Lists product-specific test scenarios and critical paths
