# Test Policy

**Document Type:** Policy | **Version:** 3.0 | **Effective Date:** March 2026 | **Review Cycle:** Annual

**Owner:** Engineering Leadership | **Approved By:** Executive Team

---

## Purpose

This Test Policy establishes Metasession's organizational commitment to quality assurance and testing excellence. It defines our philosophy, principles, accountability standards, and governance for all testing activities — including AI-assisted development.

This policy answers **"why we test"** and **"what we commit to."** For how we approach testing methodically, see the Test Strategy (`sdlc/files/Test_Strategy.md` in META-COMPLY). For what tools and patterns we use, see the Test Architecture.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- All Metasession products and client service delivery engagements
- Internal systems and infrastructure
- All team members involved in software development, quality assurance, and product delivery
- All code regardless of authorship — human-written, AI-generated, or AI-assisted

---

## Testing Philosophy

**Core Principle:** We test to ensure zero critical defects reach production and to maintain the trust of our customers, partners, and end users.

Metasession believes that:

- **Quality is non-negotiable** — Testing is not optional; it is an integral part of our definition of done
- **Prevention over detection** — We invest in early testing, automation, and continuous quality practices to prevent defects rather than finding them late
- **Risk-based approach** — Testing resources are allocated based on business risk, compliance requirements, and customer impact
- **Continuous improvement** — We regularly review and enhance our testing practices based on metrics, retrospectives, and industry best practices
- **Compliance-first mindset** — All testing activities support our ISO 27001, GDPR, and other regulatory compliance objectives
- **Accountability regardless of authorship** — The human who commits code is responsible for it, whether they wrote it manually, generated it with AI, or received it from a third party

---

## Strategic Alignment

This policy directly supports Metasession's strategic plan:

**Operational Excellence & Compliance** — Testing provides documented evidence for ISO 27001 certification audits, demonstrates adherence to secure SDLC practices, and produces automated audit trails.

**Service Market Development** — Our testing expertise differentiates Metasession as a premium QA partner and builds credibility with clients in regulated industries.

**Product Portfolio Growth** — Consistent testing standards ensure quality across all products while automation enables rapid iteration without sacrificing reliability.

---

## Organizational Commitments

### What Every Release Must Include

1. **Test planning** — Documented scope, resources, entry/exit criteria, and risks
2. **Test design** — Test cases with traceability to requirements
3. **Test execution** — Recorded evidence with timestamps, results, and responsible parties
4. **Security scanning** — Static analysis and dependency auditing on every change
5. **Defect management** — All defects tracked with severity and closure verification
6. **Test reporting** — Completion reports with pass/fail metrics and release recommendations

### Compliance Framework

Metasession's testing practices conform to:

- **ISO/IEC 29119-3** — Software testing documentation
- **ISO 27001** — Information security management
- **GDPR** — Data protection and privacy
- Industry best practices for agile testing and DevOps

### Periodic Security Commitments

Beyond per-change scanning, Metasession commits to:

- **Quarterly:** Full codebase security review, dependency deep audit, access control review, audit log integrity check
- **Annually:** Penetration testing by qualified third party, disaster recovery testing, third-party security assessment, AI use policy review

Specific schedules and procedures are defined in the Periodic Security Review Schedule.

## AI-Assisted Development Governance

### Policy Statement

Metasession embraces AI as a development tool while recognizing that AI-generated code introduces specific compliance risks requiring explicit controls. AI assistance does not reduce testing requirements — it increases them.

### The Risk Profile

AI-generated code presents risks distinct from human-authored code:

- **Confident incorrectness** — Plausible-looking code with subtle logic errors or security flaws
- **Hallucinated dependencies** — Fabricated, outdated, or vulnerable packages
- **Non-determinism** — The same prompt may produce different code on different runs
- **Training data contamination** — Reproduction of insecure patterns
- **No inherent audit trail** — No default record of what was asked or generated

### Mandatory Controls

1. **Human review as a formal compliance gate** — Every AI-generated piece of code must be reviewed by a qualified human before entering the test pipeline. The review must be logged with reviewer identity, date, and scope.

2. **Automated security scanning on every commit** — AI-generated code must pass the same SAST and dependency scanning gates as human-authored code. These are mandatory, not optional.

3. **Dependency and supply chain verification** — All dependencies in AI-assisted changes must be verified as real, current, and vulnerability-free.

4. **Regeneration triggers full retest** — If a developer regenerates a component from scratch (not incremental editing), that triggers full retest of the component and dependents. Functional equivalence cannot be assumed.

5. **Documentation proportional to risk** — Each project's Test Plan defines AI tool permissions, review requirements, and prompt/output retention based on risk level.

### Permitted AI Tools

| Tool               | Permitted Use                                                      | Restrictions                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Code generation, test generation, documentation, review assistance | No deployment without human review                |
| GitHub Copilot     | Inline code suggestions                                            | Same review requirements as any AI-generated code |

Adding a new tool requires Engineering Leadership approval and updates to this policy, the Test Strategy, and relevant project Test Plans.

### What AI May and May Not Generate

**Permitted (with mandatory human review):** Application logic, UI components, test code, database queries, migration scripts, documentation, configuration, utility functions.

**Requires elevated review (senior developer + security):** Authentication/authorization logic, cryptographic operations, payment processing, data validation for user input, API security middleware, database schema changes affecting PII.

**Prohibited (must be human-authored):** Security credentials or secrets, production environment configuration values, compliance policy documents.

### Accountability

The human who commits AI-generated code is accountable for its correctness, security, and compliance. The PR reviewer who approves it shares accountability for having verified its quality. "The AI wrote it" is not an acceptable explanation.

### EU AI Act Preparedness

Metasession monitors evolving AI regulation. For projects under high-risk classification (healthcare, employment, critical infrastructure), using AI to build the system may require disclosure and conformity assessment. Project Test Plans must address this where applicable.

---

## Risk-Based Testing

Testing effort is prioritized by risk level, determined at planning time:

**High Priority** — Sensitive data handling, security-critical functionality, regulatory compliance features, core revenue capabilities, production infrastructure changes, AI-generated code in any of these categories.

**Medium Priority** — New feature development, significant refactoring, third-party integrations, performance optimizations, AI-generated code for non-security features.

**Low Priority** — Minor UI updates, configuration changes, documentation, internal tools with limited impact.

AI involvement in Medium or High categories raises risk by one level. The Test Strategy defines specific testing depth requirements per level.
