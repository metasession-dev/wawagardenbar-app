# AI Use Disclosure — Provision of information to deployers

**Framework coverage:** `EUAIA.Art-13` (Transparency and provision of information to deployers)

**Evidence type:** `ai_disclosure` · **Cadence:** refresh every 180 days, or whenever an AI tool / model / prompt-class is added or substantively changed.

> The EU AI Act requires providers to give deployers (the people who put the AI system into use in their professional activity) **clear, comprehensive, accurate and unambiguous** information about the system's capabilities, limitations, and intended use. This file is that disclosure for our project — both for AI we develop and for third-party AI we incorporate.

## 1. Intended purpose

- **What the AI system does:** REPLACE
- **Intended use cases:** REPLACE
- **Foreseeable misuse / out-of-scope use cases:** REPLACE

## 2. Risk classification

- **Annex III high-risk category match:** REPLACE — none / list applicable categories
- **Final risk class (per Title III):** REPLACE — minimal / limited / high / unacceptable
- **Reasoning:** REPLACE

## 3. AI tools and models in use

Add one row per AI tool / model / API. Delete this template row before your first audit.

| Tool / model          | Vendor | Use case               | Inputs (data classes) | Outputs          | Risk class | Provider docs |
| --------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| REPLACE — e.g. GPT-4o | OpenAI | Code suggestion in IDE | Source code, no PII   | Code suggestions | Limited    | https://…     |
| REPLACE               |        |                        |                       |                  |            |               |

## 4. Human oversight (Art. 14)

- **Where humans intervene in the AI loop:** REPLACE — e.g. "Every AI-suggested change goes through a four-eyes code review before merge"
- **Authority of the human reviewer:** REPLACE — can they reject / override / stop the system? Document the path
- **Cross-reference to four-eyes release approval:** all releases require an approved-by audit event in the portal (closes `EUAIA.Art-14`)

## 5. Capabilities and limitations

- **Known limitations:** REPLACE — failure modes, training data cut-off, hallucination risk
- **Accuracy / robustness metrics:** REPLACE — link to test reports / benchmark results
- **Conditions under which performance degrades:** REPLACE

## 6. Data, training, validation

- **Training data provenance (if we train):** REPLACE — sources, licensing, consent
- **Fine-tuning, RAG, prompt engineering used:** REPLACE
- **Data flowing to third-party AI providers:** REPLACE — list each provider + what's sent + DPA / SCC reference (cross-link to ROPA)

## 7. Logging and traceability (Art. 12)

- **What we log:** REPLACE — prompts, completions, user/agent identity, timestamp
- **Where logs live:** REPLACE — link to portal `audit_log` evidence pipeline
- **Retention:** REPLACE
- **Closes `EUAIA.Art-12` via the `audit_log` snapshot uploaded each release.**

## 8. Deployer obligations

- **What deployers must do to use the system safely:** REPLACE — link to operator runbook
- **Notification of substantial modifications:** REPLACE — process

## 9. Sign-off

| Role                   | Name    | Date    |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Provider responsible   | REPLACE | REPLACE |
| AI compliance reviewer | REPLACE | REPLACE |
