# Incident Report — [REGRESSION] critical/express-order-portion-pricing-req097.spec.ts :: critical/express-order-portion-pricing-req097.spec.ts › REQ-097: Express Create Order — portion pricing correctness › AC3 — persisted order line price includes the portion surcharge (round trip)

**Framework coverage:**

- `ISO29119.3.5.4` (Test incident report)
- `SOC2.CC7.2` (System monitoring and incident response)
- `GDPR.Art-33` (Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority — 72h)
- `GDPR.Art-34` (Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject)

**Source:** [#718](https://github.com/metasession-dev/wawagardenbar-app/issues/718)  
**Detected:** 2026-09-08T04:16:56Z  
**Closed:** 2026-09-08T12:52:34Z

**Labels:** `incident`, `application-defect`

## 1. Personal data scope (GDPR triage) — REPLACE

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Did the incident involve personal data? | REPLACE — Y / N |
| If Y: estimated number of data subjects affected | REPLACE |
| If Y: categories of personal data involved | REPLACE |
| If Y: likely consequences for data subjects | REPLACE |
| Notify supervisory authority (Art. 33)? | REPLACE — required if Y and risk to rights/freedoms |
| Notify data subjects (Art. 34)? | REPLACE — required if high risk to rights/freedoms |
| 72-hour notification window | REPLACE — within / outside / n/a |

## 2. Narrative (from the GitHub issue)

    ## E2E Regression Failure — application-defect

    **Spec file:** critical/express-order-portion-pricing-req097.spec.ts
    **Test name:** critical/express-order-portion-pricing-req097.spec.ts › REQ-097: Express Create Order — portion pricing correctness › AC3 — persisted order line price includes the portion surcharge (round trip)
    **Final status:** failed
    **Error message:**
    ```
    Error: ^[[2mexpect(^[[22m^[[31mlocator^[[39m^[[2m).^[[22mtoBeVisible^[[2m(^[[22m^[[2m)^[[22m failed
    ```

    **Classification:** application-defect
    **Classification rationale:** Error is an assertion failure, application error, or unrecognised pattern. Defaulting to application defect (conservative).

    **testExecutionId:** 34184980490
    **Workflow run:** https://github.com/metasession-dev/wawagardenbar-app/actions/runs/34184980490
    **Git SHA:** f20c4ee889f13834f7a25b8f7019ec1f1963684d

    This regression was detected and classified by the autonomous E2E Regression CI run. A human should confirm the classification, adjust severity if needed, and close once fixed. The `incident` label ensures an `incident_report` will be generated on close.

    ### Framework attribution

    This defect, once closed with the `incident` label, will be auto-exported as `incident_report` evidence and attribute to:

    - [x] `ISO29119.3.5.4` (baseline — every incident_report)
    - [x] `SOC2.CC7.2` — ops impact: a regression in production-adjacent code is an ops concern
    - [ ] `GDPR.Art-33` — personal data scope: <REPLACE — yes/no>
    - [ ] `GDPR.Art-34` — data-subject notification required: <REPLACE — yes/no>
    - [ ] `EUAIA.Art-9 / Art-14 / Art-15` — AI failure: <REPLACE — yes/no, which article(s)>

    Once closed, the `incident-export.yml` workflow exports this issue's body to `compliance/governance/incident-report-<N>.md`.

## 3. Timeline (from issue comments)

### 2026-09-08T12:52:34Z — @metasession-dev

Confirmed flake — reproduced main's exact commit locally (fresh disposable Mongo, dev server) and all 5 tests in this spec passed. No code change; host-contention flake during the shared full-regression run.
