# Release Ticket: REQ-087 — Per-item inventory deduction with skip-on-retry

**Status:** TESTED - PENDING SIGN-OFF
**Date:** 2026-06-28
**Requirement ID:** REQ-087
**Risk Level:** HIGH
**PR:** [Will be linked when PR is created]

## Summary

Refactored `InventoryService.deductStockForOrder` from an all-or-nothing loop that throws on first failure to a per-item try/catch that returns a structured `IDeductionResult` object. Added `inventoryDeductionDetails` subdocument array to the order model for per-item deduction tracking with skip-on-retry semantics. Updated `completeOrder`, `reconcileMissedDeductions`, and `retryInventoryDeductionAction` to consume the result object, persist per-item state, and write detailed IncidentEvents with item breakdowns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1 — partial failure: items 1 and 3 deducted, item 2 failed
- [x] AC2 — skip-on-retry: already-deducted items are skipped
- [x] AC3 — IncidentEvent contains deductedItems, failedItems, skippedItems arrays
- [x] AC4 — all items succeed → allSucceeded true, inventoryDeducted set
- [ ] AC5 — over-sell E2E regression (deferred to CI)
- [x] All security testing items pass
- [x] TypeScript clean
- [x] SAST clean (0 new findings)
- [x] Dependencies clean
- [x] AI use documented

## Risk Assessment

- No new risks introduced. Per-item try/catch adds negligible overhead (same DB calls, restructured flow).
- No new dependencies.
- No new endpoints or auth surfaces.
- Existing E2E regression tests updated to match new IncidentEvent shape.

## Post-Deploy Actions

| Type | Script / Command | Target | Required | Notes                           |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
