# derive-release-version.sh — Pick the release version for CI uploads from
# the latest commit's REQ tag, falling back to a bare date.
#
# Usage:
#   VERSION=$(./scripts/derive-release-version.sh)
#
# Priority:
#   1. REQ tag in commit subject:   "[REQ-037] feat(kitchen): ..." -> REQ-037
#   2. Ref in commit body:          "Ref: REQ-037"                 -> REQ-037
#   3. Bracketed tag in commit body: merge commit whose body is the PR title
#                                    "... [REQ-037] ..."           -> REQ-037
#   4. Fallback:                    bare date                      -> v2026.05.17
#
# The id is taken from a bracketed [REQ-XXX] tag (subject or body) or the
# `Ref:` line — NOT from unbracketed prose (e.g. "target close: REQ-002" must
# not win over "Ref: REQ-001"). Step 3 exists because a "Merge pull request"
# commit carries the PR title (with its [REQ-XXX] tag) in the body, not the
# subject — without it, PR-merged work falls through to the date fallback and
# fragments onto a phantom date release. Output: single line on stdout.
#
# This ties a release record (project_id, version) to the feature the
# commits belong to, so all CI uploads for one REQ converge on one
# release container — fixing the fragmentation described in DevAudit #310.
#
# Install: cp this file to your project's scripts/ directory && chmod +x scripts/derive-release-version.sh

# 2. Body: the id on the `Ref:` line only (case-insensitive on "Ref"/"REQ").
# Scoping to the Ref: line prevents a prose mention earlier in the body
# (e.g. "target close: REQ-002") from being picked over the real ref.

# 3. Body: a bracketed [REQ-XXX] anywhere in the body. Catches a merge commit
# whose body is the PR title — e.g. subject "Merge pull request #7 from …",
# body "chore(deps): [REQ-002] …". Bracketed-only, so an unbracketed prose
# mention ("target close: REQ-002") still cannot win over a real Ref: above.

# 4. Pending-release ticket fallback (REQ-053 release patch — also
#    proposed upstream as DevAudit-Installer#92 Layer 1). When HEAD is a
#    housekeeping commit (chore: sync, ci: fix, docs:) that doesn't carry
#    the REQ tag, but there's exactly one open release ticket on disk
#    naming a REQ, treat that as the in-progress release. Multiple
#    pending tickets → ambiguous → stay with the bare-date fallback below.
